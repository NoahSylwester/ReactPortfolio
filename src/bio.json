        "I was recently a main developer in the construction of a tightly integrated suite of iOS/Android/web hybrid apps for church leaders and musicians, through which users can schedule events, plan presentations, communicate with their organization, and read or listen to music. Through attention to user feedback and consistent updates that userbase has grown by thousands. I'm looking forward to getting in on the ground floor of another project, or to help grow something great into something amazing!",
        "I'm a former freelance musician, and I bring that same discipline and drive for excellence to my software work. I also love learning and talking about music. Ask me about the oboe, or good banjo players!"
