        "Full stack web developer with years of technical/professional experience and a background in applied physics powering my problem-solving skills. I have a track record of strong performance in TypeScript/JavaScript, HTML5, CSS, common JS frameworks like Vue, Angular and React, and iOS development. I'm also known for being easy to work with, and for my driving work ethic and innovative problem-solving abilities. With each project, my aim is to engage and empower my audience by creating a seamless and intuitive user experience.",
        "I was recently a central developer in the construction of a tightly integrated suite of iOS/Android/web hybrid apps for church leaders and musicians, through which users can schedule events, plan presentations, communicate with their organization, and read or listen to music. Through attention to user feedback and consistent updates that userbase has grown by thousands. I'm looking forward to getting in on the ground floor of another project, or to help grow something great into something amazing!",
        "I'm a former freelance musician, and I bring that same discipline and drive for excellence to my software work. I also love learning and talking about music. Ask me about the oboe, flamenco guitar, or good banjo players!"
